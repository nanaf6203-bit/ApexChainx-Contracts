## Overview

This repository contains Soroban smart contracts that power the ApexChainx
platform. These contracts execute on the **Stellar network** and are invoked
exclusively through the backend API layer.

### Primary Responsibilities

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| SLA Calculation | Deterministic penalty/reward computation based on service metrics |
| Payment Escrow | Lock and conditionally release Stellar token payments |
| Multi-Party Settlement | Split shared outage costs between multiple parties |

### Invocation Model

```
Backend API → Contract Invocation → Result Processing → Payment Execution
```

**Key constraint:** Contracts are never called directly by the frontend.
All interactions go through the backend bridge.

---

## Core Contracts

### 1. SLA Calculator

Responsible for:

- calculating SLA results (penalty or reward)
- returning deterministic results
- storing configuration

Key functions:

- initialize
- calculate_sla
- execute_payment
- get_config
- update_config

Important:

- must be deterministic
- must not depend on external state
- must match backend SLA logic exactly

---

### 2. Payment Escrow

Responsible for:

- locking funds
- releasing funds on conditions
- handling refunds

Key functions:

- create_escrow
- release_escrow
- refund_escrow

---

### 3. Multi-Party Settlement

Responsible for:

- splitting payments between parties
- handling shared outage costs

Key functions:

- create_settlement
- execute_settlement

---

## Architecture

Contracts are:

- stateless where possible
- deterministic
- executed via backend
- validated by Stellar network

Flow:
Backend → Contract Invocation → Result → Payment Execution

---

## Important Constraints

- calculations must be deterministic
- no floating point errors (use integers)
- gas cost must be minimized
- contracts must be idempotent where applicable
- inputs must be validated strictly

---

## Critical Logic

### SLA Calculation

Inputs:

- severity
- MTTR
- threshold config

Output:

- status (met / violated)
- amount (positive = reward, negative = penalty)

Must exactly match backend logic.

---

## Known Risk Areas (Generate Issues)

### SLA Logic

- mismatch between backend and contract
- incorrect rounding or integer precision
- edge cases (boundary MTTR values)

### Payments

- double execution risk
- missing authorization checks
- incorrect recipient addresses

### Security

- admin privilege misuse
- contract initialization errors
- unauthorized config updates

### Gas Optimization

- unnecessary storage writes
- inefficient loops
- repeated computation

---

## Coding Rules

- use integer math only
- avoid unnecessary state writes
- validate all inputs
- emit events for important actions
- keep functions small and testable

---

## Testing Requirements

- unit tests for each function
- edge case tests
- integration tests with backend expectations
- deterministic output validation

---

## Cross-Repo Dependencies

- apexchainx-be → invokes contracts
- apexchainx-fe → displays results

Important:

- contract logic must never diverge from backend expectations
- API response structure depends on contract output
- result symbol mappings are versioned through the contract-facing schema

## Backend-Facing Result Schema

The SLA calculator now exposes an explicit result schema contract so the backend
does not have to infer symbol meanings implicitly.

Current schema version:

- schema label: `v1`
- schema version: `1`

Current symbol mappings:

- status met -> `met`
- status violated -> `viol`
- payment reward -> `rew`
- payment penalty -> `pen`
- rating exceptional -> `top`
- rating excellent -> `excel`
- rating good -> `good`
- rating poor -> `poor`

Compatibility rule:\n\n- additive read-only contract helpers are preferred over changing the shape of\n  `SLAResult`\n- **Versioning**: Breaking ABI/symbol changes → MAJOR bump (v2.0.0), update `schema_version` in `get_result_schema()`.\n- Backend: Pin contract ID/version, regenerate parity tests from snapshots post-release.\n\n**Backend Dependency Expectations**:\n- Match `calculate_sla_view()` exactly with local logic.\n- Consume `test_snapshots/tests/*.json` for golden vectors.\n- Monitor git tags `vX.Y.Z` for releases.\n\n## Event Convention

Lifecycle events are versioned so backend consumers can reason about event shape
without inferring it from position alone.

Current event topic convention:

- topic 0 -> event name
- topic 1 -> event version
- topic 2 -> event-specific context such as severity or caller

Current event version:

- `v1`

Current SLA calculation event payload:

- outage id
- result status
- payment type
- rating
- MTTR minutes
- threshold minutes
- amount

---

## SC-097: Event Replay and Recovery Guidance

### Intended Event Consumption

Backend consumers should treat the SLA calculator's on-chain events as a
supplementary audit trail, not as the primary source of truth for SLA outcomes.
The canonical state is always the most recent `calculate_sla` result stored
on-chain and retrieved via direct contract reads.

### Event Replay Assumptions

- Events are emitted with a versioned topic layout (`v1`). Consumers must check
  `topic[1]` before deserialising the payload to avoid version mismatches.
- Events are not guaranteed to be present for every ledger (e.g. archival or
  network gaps). Consumers must handle missing events gracefully.
- Re-processing the same event twice must be idempotent on the backend — use the
  `outage_id` field as a deduplication key.

### Missed-Event Recovery

1. Detect a gap by comparing the last processed ledger sequence against the
   current ledger sequence from `getLatestLedger`.
2. Use `getEvents` with an explicit `startLedger` to replay missed events in
   chronological order.
3. Cross-check replayed results against `calculate_sla_view` for the same
   `outage_id` to validate consistency.
4. Log any discrepancy between the event payload and the on-chain state as a
   potential double-execution risk.

### Canonical State vs Event-Stream Interpretation

| Operation | Recommended source |
|---|---|
| Current SLA result for an outage | Direct contract read (`calculate_sla_view`) |
| Audit / history of all outages | Event stream replay |
| Config at a point in time | `cfg_upd` events + `get_config` |
| Payment amounts | Event payload `amount` field (signed integer) |

## Goal for Codex

Generate issues that:

- improve contract correctness
- ensure security of payments
- optimize gas usage
- guarantee deterministic behavior
